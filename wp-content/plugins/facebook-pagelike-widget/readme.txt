* If widget works great in all browsers except Mozilla Firefox, You must press the settings off "Use protection against tracking in private window", its security settings for Mozilla, nothing to do with my plugin.

= How do I sign up for a Facebook application ID for my website = 
* You may create a new Facebook application or edit your existing Facebook application through the [Facebook Developers application interface](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). You need to signup for a Facebook Developer account first.

= I am not sure how to get Facebook application ID ? =
* If you are not able to create Facebook application or you do not know how to do that, do not worry, you can use my default application id `1590918427791514` . I have created it for plugin users and it should work like a charm for you.
